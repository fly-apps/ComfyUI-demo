[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) will let you design and execute advanced Stable Diffusion pipelines using a graph/nodes/flowchart based interface.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This app is designed to run on [Fly GPUs](https://fly.io/docs/gpus/) — if you try to run it on a normal Fly Machine, you're gonna have a Bad Time™
